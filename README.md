# learn_quantum
Files relating to Quantum Programming Book.  There are PDF chapters and the supporting source code in Jupyter files. You will need to download the learn_quantum.py library which has the commone routines.  These common routines mainly support formatting the output from Qiskit in Latex and displaying it in Jupyter. 

Please note that learn_quantum.py reverses the matrix entires from Qiskit so that they are displayed in the standard format used in academic texts.
